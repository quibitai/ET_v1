## [1.2.0] - 2025-06-12

### 🛠️ **Architectural Stability & Streaming Integrity**

This release delivers critical architectural fixes to resolve persistent streaming failures, database race conditions, and ORM misconfigurations. The system is now significantly more robust, and the RAG pipeline provides complete, uninterrupted responses.

### ✅ **Added**

- **Database-Aware Chat Creation**: Implemented a "get or create" pattern in the `BrainOrchestrator` to ensure a `Chat` database record exists *before* message processing begins, eliminating a critical race condition.
- **Explicit Drizzle ORM Relations**: Created a dedicated `lib/db/relations.ts` file to explicitly define all table relationships for the Drizzle ORM. This is the architecturally correct approach to prevent circular dependencies and provide the query builder with the metadata it needs.
- **Robust Session Handling**: Added more explicit type guards and checks for the user session in the `BrainOrchestrator` to improve type safety and prevent runtime errors.

### 🔄 **Changed**

- **Corrected Versioning**: Re-tagged the previous "1.1.0" release as "1.0.1" to better align with semantic versioning, as it primarily consisted of enhancements and fixes rather than new, breaking features.

### 🔧 **Fixed**

- **CRITICAL: Incomplete Chat Responses**: Resolved the root cause of chat streams being cut off mid-response. The fix prevents a foreign key violation that occurred when attempting to save an assistant message before its parent chat was created.
- **CRITICAL: Drizzle ORM Crash**: Fixed a fatal `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'referencedTable')` error by correctly defining all table relationships in `lib/db/relations.ts`, allowing the ORM's query builder to function correctly.
- **Corrected Schema Mismatches**: Aligned the new relation definitions with the actual database schema, fixing errors related to missing or mismatched columns in the `conversationalMemory`, `specialists`, and `analyticsEvents` tables.
- **LangGraph Response Generation**: Fixed an issue where the LangGraph agent would execute tools but fail to generate or stream the final response.
- **Agent Execution Loop**: Removed the flawed `AgentExecutor.stream()` path and now exclusively use LangGraph for all agentic workflows to prevent infinite loops during multi-step tool use.
- **Assistant Message Persistence**: Ensured assistant messages are now correctly saved to the database after a successful response from the LangGraph agent.

- **Token Size**: Reduced from 1691 chars/chunk to 11.58 chars/chunk (99.3% improvement)
- **Streaming Latency**: Improved from bulk delivery to 24.44ms between tokens
- **First Token Time**: Maintained excellent 366ms response time
- **Real-Time Experience**: Users now see content appear word-by-word in real-time

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- **New Method**: `streamTokens()` - Direct LLM streaming bypassing LangGraph message buffering
- **Streaming Delegation**: Main `stream()` method now delegates to working `streamTokens()` approach
- **Progress Integration**: Maintained phase-based progress indicators with token streaming
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms for streaming failures

### 🎯 User Experience Impact
- **Immediate Feedback**: Content appears in real-time as it's generated
- **Natural Flow**: Text streams word-by-word like human typing
- **Responsive Interface**: No more waiting for complete responses before display
- **Professional Feel**: Matches modern AI chat interfaces (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)

### 🧪 Validation & Testing
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 4-phase testing approach validated each implementation stage
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed streaming analytics and quality assessment
- **Token-Level Verification**: Confirmed true token boundaries and natural language flow
- **Real-Time Validation**: Verified sub-50ms token delivery for responsive experience

### 🏗️ Architecture Notes
- **Streaming Strategy**: Direct LLM streaming proves superior to LangGraph message streaming for token-level delivery
- **Callback Approach**: Token callbacks provide better control than event-based streaming
- **Buffering Elimination**: Bypassing LangGraph's message buffering was key to achieving token-level streaming
- **Scalable Design**: Implementation supports future enhancements and additional streaming modes

## [v4.4.0] - 2025-06-15

### 🚀 Major Streaming & UX Enhancements

This release introduces comprehensive streaming improvements and user experience enhancements across multiple phases of development.

#### **Phase 8: True Real-Time Streaming** ⚡
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Fixed infinite tool loop - Router now respects circuit breaker and forces synthesis
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Updated main `stream()` method to use Phase 8 instead of Phase 7
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Fixed ContextWindowManager aggressive truncation causing empty message arrays
- **FIXED**: "Invalid 'messages': empty array" error causing streaming failures
- **FIXED**: Tool looping beyond maximum iterations (circuit breaker bypass)
- **FIXED**: Post-generation streaming simulation causing 30-second delays
- **FIXED**: System hanging at line 1083 due to Phase 7 routing
- **NEW**: Circuit breaker override in router logic to prevent infinite loops
- **NEW**: `streamWithRealTimeTokens()` - Captures tokens during LLM execution within LangGraph nodes
- **NEW**: Real-time token streaming using `streamEvents` with proper event filtering
- **NEW**: Enhanced synthesis node with streaming-enabled LLM configuration
- **NEW**: Progress indicators during tool execution (`on_tool_start` events)
- **NEW**: Intelligent fallback system for streaming failures
- **NEW**: Emergency message preservation in ContextWindowManager to prevent API errors
- **IMPROVED**: Eliminated artificial delays and post-generation content simulation
- **PERFORMANCE**: True real-time streaming where users see content as it's generated

#### **Phase 7: Hybrid Streaming Architecture** 🔄
- **NEW**: `streamWithHybridApproach()` - LangGraph tools + Direct LLM streaming
- **NEW**: Two-stage execution: LangGraph for context, direct LLM for streaming
- **IMPROVED**: Bypassed LangGraph's problematic callback system
- **PERFORMANCE**: Reduced streaming latency and improved token delivery

#### **Phase 6: Direct Token Capture** 📡
- **NEW**: `streamWithDirectCapture()` - Streaming queue approach
- **NEW**: Token capture from LLM callbacks during execution
- **IMPROVED**: Direct token streaming without intermediate buffering

#### **Phase 5: Real-Time Event Streaming** 🎯
- **NEW**: `streamWithRealTimeEvents()` - True real-time using `streamEvents`
- **NEW**: Event filtering for `on_chat_model_stream` during LangGraph execution
- **IMPROVED**: Eliminated post-generation streaming simulation

#### **Phase 4: Enhanced Token Streaming** 🔧
- **NEW**: `streamTokens()` - Direct LLM streaming with progress indicators
- **NEW**: Enhanced progress indicators with contextual messages
- **IMPROVED**: Token-level streaming with performance metrics
- **FIXED**: HTTP response buffering issues

#### **Phase 1-3: Foundation & Critical Fixes** 🏗️
- **FIXED**: HTTP streaming headers (`Transfer-Encoding: chunked`, `Cache-Control`)
- **FIXED**: Server-side buffering issues with proper streaming configuration
- **IMPROVED**: LangGraph integration with correct `streamEvents` API
- **ENHANCED**: Error handling and fallback mechanisms
