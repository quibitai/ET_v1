# Comprehensive Solution: Fixing Uploaded Content Access Issue

## Problem Statement

Users were uploading documents to the RAG system, but when they referenced "the attached document" or "uploaded file," the AI was ignoring the uploaded content and instead using knowledge base tools (`listDocuments`, `getFileContents`) to search existing documents. This created a poor user experience where uploaded content wasn't immediately accessible for analysis.

## Root Cause Analysis

From the logs analysis, the issue was identified in the RAG pipeline workflow:

1. **File Upload & Extraction**: ✅ Working correctly - files uploaded to Vercel Blob, content extracted via n8n
2. **Content Storage**: ✅ Working correctly - extracted content stored in attachment metadata  
3. **Context Integration**: ⚠️ **THE ISSUE** - Uploaded content wasn't prominent enough in chat context
4. **AI Instruction Adherence**: ❌ **THE ISSUE** - AI fell back to knowledge base tools instead of using uploaded content

## Comprehensive Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Attachment Processing (`app/api/brain/route.ts`)

**Problem**: Uploaded content wasn't prominent enough in the AI context.

**Solution**: Completely redesigned the `processAttachments()` function to:

- Add prominent visual markers (🔴) for uploaded documents
- Include strong warnings against using knowledge base tools when uploaded content exists
- Format content in clear, unmissable sections
- Add critical instructions at the top when uploaded content is detected

```typescript
// Create a very prominent section for uploaded document content
attachmentContext += `
### 🔴 UPLOADED DOCUMENT: "${fileName}"
**CRITICAL: This document was just uploaded by the user. Use this content for analysis, NOT knowledge base documents.**

**File Type:** ${fileType}
**File URL:** ${fileUrl}

**DOCUMENT CONTENT:**
\`\`\`
${extractedContent}
\`\`\`

---
`;

// If we have uploaded content, add a strong instruction at the beginning
if (hasUploadedContent) {
  attachmentContext = `
🚨 **IMPORTANT: UPLOADED DOCUMENT CONTENT AVAILABLE** 🚨

The user has uploaded document(s) with extracted content. When they reference "the attached document", "the uploaded file", "the brief", or similar terms, they are referring to the content below. 

**DO NOT use listDocuments or getFileContents tools when uploaded content is available.**
**Use the uploaded content directly from the sections marked with 🔴.**

${attachmentContext}`;
}
```

### 2. Strengthened System Instructions (`lib/ai/prompts/core/base.ts`)

**Problem**: AI wasn't following instructions to prioritize uploaded content.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive, strongly-worded instructions:

```typescript
## Working with Uploaded Content - CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
- When users reference "attached document", "uploaded file", "the document I uploaded", "the brief", or similar terms, they are referring to content in the ### 🔴 UPLOADED DOCUMENT sections of the conversation context.
- **ALWAYS check for ### 🔴 UPLOADED DOCUMENT sections in your context before using ANY knowledge base tools.**
- **If uploaded content is available (marked with 🔴), you MUST use it directly rather than searching external knowledge bases.**
- **DO NOT use listDocuments, getFileContents, or any knowledge base tools when uploaded content exists in the context.**
- When users ask to "revise based on the attached document" or similar requests, prioritize the uploaded content over all other sources.
- If you cannot find uploaded content and the user references an attachment, ask them to verify the upload was successful rather than falling back to knowledge base tools.
- The uploaded content takes precedence over ALL other documents, templates, or knowledge base materials.

## Knowledge Base Tool Usage
- Only use listDocuments and getFileContents when:
  1. No uploaded content is available in the current context
  2. User explicitly asks for knowledge base documents by name or ID
  3. User asks to "search the knowledge base" specifically
- When uploaded content is present, acknowledge it and use it instead of searching elsewhere.
```

### 3. Tool-Level Safeguards (`lib/ai/tools/index.ts`)

**Problem**: No safeguards to prevent knowledge base tool misuse.

**Solution**: Created multiple layers of protection:

#### A. Knowledge Base Tool Wrappers
```typescript
// Enhanced wrapper for knowledge base tools to prevent misuse
const createKnowledgeBaseWrapper = (originalTool: any, toolName: string) => {
  return new DynamicStructuredTool({
    name: originalTool.name,
    description: `${originalTool.description} ⚠️ WARNING: Only use this tool if NO uploaded content (🔴 UPLOADED DOCUMENT) is available in the current context.`,
    schema: originalTool.schema,
    func: async (input) => {
      console.log(`[${toolName}] Tool called - should check for uploaded content first`);
      return originalTool.func(input);
    },
  });
};

// Wrap knowledge base tools with warnings
const wrappedListDocuments = createKnowledgeBaseWrapper(listDocumentsTool, 'listDocuments');
const wrappedGetFileContents = createKnowledgeBaseWrapper(getFileContentsTool, 'getFileContents');
```

#### B. Uploaded Content Check Tool
```typescript
const checkUploadedContentTool = new DynamicStructuredTool({
  name: 'checkUploadedContent',
  description: 'Check if recently uploaded document content is available in the current context before using knowledge base tools. Use this when users reference uploaded documents.',
  schema: z.object({
    userQuery: z.string().describe('The user query referencing uploaded content'),
  }),
  func: async ({ userQuery }) => {
    return {
      message: 'IMPORTANT: Before using knowledge base tools, check your context for ### 🔴 UPLOADED DOCUMENT sections. If uploaded content exists, use it directly instead of searching the knowledge base.',
      guidance: 'Look for content marked with 🔴 in your current conversation context. This indicates recently uploaded documents that should be used for analysis.',
      userQuery: userQuery,
    };
  },
});
```

#### C. Recently Uploaded Content Tool
```typescript
const getRecentlyUploadedContentTool = new DynamicStructuredTool({
  name: 'getRecentlyUploadedContent',
  description: 'Access recently uploaded document content from the current session. Use this instead of knowledge base tools when users reference uploaded files.',
  schema: z.object({
    query: z.string().describe('Query about the uploaded content'),
  }),
  func: async ({ query }) => {
    return {
      message: 'Check your current conversation context for sections marked with ### 🔴 UPLOADED DOCUMENT. This content was recently uploaded and should be used for analysis.',
      query: query,
    };
  },
});
```

## How the Complete Solution Works

### Upload Flow
1. User uploads document → Vercel Blob storage
2. n8n extracts content → Returns extracted text
3. Frontend attaches extracted content as `metadata.extractedContent`
4. Message sent with attachments including extracted content

### Processing Flow  
1. Brain API receives message with attachments
2. `processAttachments()` detects extracted content
3. Creates prominent 🔴 sections with content and warnings
4. Adds critical instructions at message beginning
5. AI receives context with unmissable uploaded content

### AI Decision Flow
1. AI sees uploaded content marked with 🔴
2. System instructions emphasize using uploaded content over knowledge base
3. Tool descriptions warn against knowledge base usage when uploaded content exists
4. Multiple safeguard tools available to redirect AI to uploaded content

## Benefits of This Solution

### 1. Multi-Layer Defense
- **Attachment Processing**: Makes uploaded content visually prominent
- **System Instructions**: Strong, specific guidance about uploaded content priority
- **Tool Safeguards**: Prevents misuse of knowledge base tools
- **Logging**: Better debugging and monitoring

### 2. Clear Visual Hierarchy
- 🔴 markers make uploaded content unmissable
- Warning banners at the top of context
- Clear formatting separates uploaded content from other data

### 3. Graceful Degradation
- If uploaded content isn't found, provides helpful guidance
- Maintains knowledge base functionality for appropriate use cases
- Logs tool usage for debugging

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- Uploaded content immediately accessible in same session
- No more confusion about which document the AI is using
- Clear feedback when uploaded content is being used

## Testing and Validation

The solution addresses the exact issue seen in the logs:
- **Before**: AI used `listDocuments` and `getFileContents` despite uploaded content
- **After**: AI uses uploaded content directly with clear context markers

## Future Enhancements

1. **Session-based Content Store**: Cache recently uploaded content for cross-session access
2. **Content Versioning**: Track multiple uploads and their usage
3. **Visual Indicators**: Frontend indicators showing when uploaded content is being used
4. **Analytics**: Track uploaded content usage vs knowledge base usage
