# Schema Patching Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The root cause of the persistent Asana integration issues was the `SimpleLangGraphWrapper.applySchemaPatching()` method, which was sabotaging properly defined tools in two ways:

1. **Destructive Generic Conversion**: Any tool name containing "asana" was converted to a generic `z.object({ input: z.any() })` schema, completely destroying the tool's parameter structure and functionality.

2. **Incomplete Fixed Tools List**: The `fixedTools` array only included 7 tools, missing most of the 33 Asana tools that are now properly defined.

## The Fix Applied

### Updated `applySchemaPatching()` Method

1. **Expanded Fixed Tools List**: Added all 33 Asana tools to the `fixedTools` array:
   - `asana_list_workspaces`
   - `asana_search_projects` 
   - `asana_search_tasks`
   - `asana_get_task`
   - `asana_create_task`
   - `asana_get_task_stories`
   - `asana_update_task`
   - `asana_get_project`
   - `asana_get_project_task_counts`
   - `asana_get_project_sections`
   - `asana_create_task_story`
   - `asana_add_task_dependencies`
   - `asana_add_task_dependents`
   - `asana_create_subtask`
   - `asana_add_followers_to_task`
   - `asana_get_multiple_tasks_by_gid`
   - `asana_get_project_status`
   - `asana_get_project_statuses`
   - `asana_create_project_status`
   - `asana_delete_project_status`
   - `asana_set_parent_for_task`
   - `asana_get_tasks_for_tag`
   - `asana_get_tags_for_workspace`
   - `asana_create_section_for_project`
   - `asana_add_task_to_section`
   - `asana_create_project`
   - `asana_get_teams_for_user`
   - `asana_get_teams_for_workspace`
   - `asana_list_workspace_users`
   - `asana_get_project_hierarchy`
   - `asana_get_attachments_for_object`
   - `asana_upload_attachment_for_object`
   - `asana_download_attachment`

2. **Removed Destructive Logic**: Eliminated the code that converted tools containing "asana" to generic schemas.

3. **Improved Logging**: Added better logging to track which tools are being processed and how.

## Expected Outcome

With this fix:
- All Asana tools should now use their properly defined schemas with `.optional().nullable()` parameters
- The agent should be able to properly call Asana tools with correct parameter structures
- Tool calls should include proper default parameters like `assignee: 'me'` and `completed: false`
- The disconnect between diagnostic tests and main application flow should be resolved

## Verification Plan

### 1. Check Application Logs
Look for log messages like:
```
[LangGraph Agent] âœ… Tool 'asana_search_tasks' has proper OpenAI-compatible schema, using as-is
```

### 2. Test Basic Asana Query
Try a simple query like: "List my current Asana tasks"

Expected behavior:
- Should call `asana_search_tasks` with proper parameters
- Should return actual user tasks, not other people's tasks
- Should include clickable links to tasks
- Should NOT generate executive summaries

### 3. Monitor for Schema Errors
Watch for any remaining Zod validation errors in the logs.

### 4. Test Tool Parameter Binding
Verify that Asana tools receive properly structured parameters, not generic `{ input: any }` objects.

## Files Modified

- `lib/ai/graphs/simpleLangGraphWrapper.ts`: Updated `applySchemaPatching()` method
- Previous fixes in:
  - `lib/ai/tools/list-documents.ts`
  - `lib/ai/tools/multi-document-retrieval.ts` 
  - `lib/ai/tools/search-internal-knowledge-base.ts`
  - `lib/ai/tools/mcp/asana/index.ts`

## Git Status

- All changes committed to `debugging/schema-fixes` branch
- Ready for testing and potential merge to main branch

## Next Steps

1. Test the application with real Asana queries
2. Monitor logs for proper tool usage
3. Verify that original issues are resolved:
   - Correct task filtering (user's tasks only)
   - Simple list responses (no executive summaries)
   - Proper hyperlinks in responses
   - No redundant "References" sections
