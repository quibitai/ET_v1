- 💬 AI assistant with streaming responses using OpenAI models (GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1-mini)
- 🔄 N8N integration for data processing workflows
- 🔐 Authentication and session management
- 🎨 Modern UI with dark mode support
- 📱 Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- 🔒 Secure environment variable handling
- 🧠 Intelligent tool selection with search-before-creation logic
- 📤 Advanced file upload functionality:
  - Drag-and-drop support for various file types
  - PDF document extraction
  - Excel/CSV data conversion to readable formats
  - Image handling for AI vision capabilities
  - Intelligent JSON data formatting
- 🛠️ Dual model support:
  - Echo Tango Bit (GPT-4.1-mini) for general chat
  - Orchestrator (GPT-4.1) for advanced reasoning

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables (see `.env.example` for details):

- N8N Webhook configurations (URLs, auth headers, tokens)
- Authentication secret
- Database URL
- OpenAI API key
- Vercel Blob storage token (for file uploads)

## N8N Workflows

This project uses several n8n workflows for document processing, search, and retrieval:

1. **Internal Knowledge Base Search Tool**
   - Performs semantic search using embeddings stored in PostgreSQL vector database
   - Extracts relevant content from stored documents based on similarity
   - Returns formatted results with source attribution
   - Uses OpenAI text-embedding-3-small model for vector embeddings

2. **Web Search Tool (SerpAPI Integration)**
   - Performs web searches using Google Search API via SerpAPI
   - Uses an AI Agent with GPT-4.1-mini to process and summarize search results
   - Maintains conversation context using memory components
   - Returns well-formatted, context-aware summaries

3. **Document Management Tools**
   - **List Documents Tool**: Returns metadata for all documents in the knowledge base
   - **Document Retrieval Tool**: Fetches full content of specific documents by ID
   - **Spreadsheet Query Tool**: Executes structured queries against tabular data

4. **Google Drive Integration**
   - Automatic monitoring for new/updated files in specified Google Drive folders
   - Handles various file types (PDF, XLSX, CSV, Google Docs, etc.)
   - Converts files to text and creates embeddings for semantic search
   - Maintains document metadata for efficient retrieval

5. **Google Calendar Integration**
   - Search calendar events with natural language queries
   - Create, update, and delete calendar events
   - Supports complex date/time parsing
   - Returns structured event data with proper formatting

6. **File Extraction Service**
   - Processes uploaded files from various sources
   - Extracts text from PDFs, spreadsheets, and other document types
   - Converts structured data to readable formats
   - Uses content-type detection for appropriate extraction methods

All workflows are configured with webhook endpoints, authentication headers, and relevant database connections. See the [N8N Workflows Documentation](./docs/N8N_WORKFLOWS.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Testing Webhooks

Test scripts are provided in the `/tests` directory:

```bash
node tests/test-updated-n8n-webhook.js      # Test RAG search
node tests/test-list-docs-webhook.js        # Test document listing
node tests/test-get-contents-webhook.js     # Test content retrieval
node tests/test-query-rows-webhook.js       # Test data queries
```

## Deployment

1. Configure n8n instance with the workflows described in the documentation
2. Set up PostgreSQL database with vector extensions
3. Configure environment variables for authentication and API integrations
4. Deploy to Vercel or your preferred hosting platform
