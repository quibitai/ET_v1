## üåü Overview

Quibit RAG is a modular, multi-tenant AI assistant platform that combines modern language models with retrieval techniques and a robust tool registry. It is built on Next.js, LangChain, and Supabase, and is designed for extensibility, maintainability, and real-time streaming.

- **Client-Aware Configuration:** Each client receives a unique, context-aware experience, with custom prompts, tool access, and specialist personas driven by database configuration.
- **General Chat Specialist:** A dedicated, client-contextualized "General Chat" specialist provides a helpful, conversational AI experience for standard chat contexts.
- **Modular Tool Registry:** Easily add, remove, or update tools for document search, file handling, calendar, web search, and more.
- **Streaming Responses:** Real-time chat and document updates via SSE.
- **Multi-Tenancy:** Client-aware context, permissions, and data isolation.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive, real-time interface with file upload and document editing.
- **Direct API Integrations:** Google Drive, Supabase, Tavily, Google Calendar (via n8n MCP), and more.
- **Prompt System:** Modular, context-aware prompt composition for orchestrator and specialist personas.

## ‚ú® Key Features in v2.0.0

- **Client-Aware Configuration System:** Prompts, tool access, and specialist personas are dynamically tailored per client using a unified configuration schema. See [Prompt Architecture and Configuration Guide](./Prompt%20Architecture%20and%20Configuration%20Guide.md).
- **General Chat Specialist:** The "General Chat" context now uses a dedicated, client-contextualized specialist prompt, not the Orchestrator prompt.
- **Unified Specialist Registry:** All specialists (including General Chat) are registered and managed centrally, ensuring no duplicates in the UI.
- **Comprehensive Test Suite:** New unit and integration tests validate prompt generation, tool configuration, and client context injection. See [tests/prompts/README.md](./tests/prompts/README.md).
- **Stable, Clean Baseline:** This version is a stable, working baseline for further development (e.g., artifact streaming). Tag and revert to this version as needed.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Quibit RAG follows a modular, streaming architecture:

### Client Layer
- Next.js front-end with React components
- Real-time streaming UI (SSE)
- File upload and document editor

### API Layer
- `/api/brain`: Central orchestration endpoint (LangChain agent, streaming)
- `/api/files/upload`: File upload (Vercel Blob)
- `/api/files/extract`: File extraction (n8n workflow)
- Authentication via NextAuth

### Brain Orchestration
- LangChain agent with dynamic toolset
- Modular tool registry (`lib/ai/tools/`)
- Prompt system with orchestrator and specialist personas
- Streaming SSE responses

### Data Layer
- PostgreSQL (Supabase) for structured and vector data
- Vercel Blob for file storage
- n8n for file extraction and some MCP integrations

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- PostgreSQL database
- Supabase account for vector storage
- OpenAI API key
- Google API credentials
- n8n instance (optional, for file extraction/MCP)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/quibitai/Quibit_RAG.git
cd Quibit_RAG
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Configure essential environment variables in `.env.local`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_key
POSTGRES_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secure_secret

# Optional n8n configuration (for file extraction/MCP)
N8N_EXTRACT_WEBHOOK_URL=your_n8n_webhook_url
N8N_EXTRACT_AUTH_TOKEN=your_n8n_auth_token
```

5. Run database migrations:
```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

6. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Access the application at http://localhost:3000

## üìÇ File Processing Capabilities

- **Primary Extraction (n8n):** Uses n8n workflow for optimal extraction (text-based files)
- **Direct Upload:** All files are uploaded to Vercel Blob
- **Format-Specific Handling:** Microsoft Office, PDF, text, JSON, images, etc.

## üß© Core Components

- **Message Handling:** Type-safe, multi-layered sanitization, robust error handling
- **Brain API:** Central orchestration, streaming, context-aware, multi-tenant
- **Tool Integration:** Modular, direct API integrations, n8n for extraction/MCP only
- **Prompt System:** Modular, context-aware, orchestrator and specialist personas
- **Client-Aware Specialist Registry:** All specialists (including General Chat) are registered in a single registry, ensuring no duplicates in the UI or logic.

## üß™ Development & Testing

- Run tests: `npm test` or see [tests/prompts/README.md](./tests/prompts/README.md)
- Run migrations: `npm run db:migrate`
- Generate migration: `npm run db:generate`

## üîÑ Reverting to v2.0.0 (Stable Baseline)

To revert to this clean, working version if you break things during artifact streaming or other experiments:

```bash
git checkout v2.0.0
```

Or, if you want to create a new branch from this version:

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature-base v2.0.0
```
