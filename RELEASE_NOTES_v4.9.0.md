# Release Notes - v4.9.0

**Release Date:** December 19, 2024  
**Type:** Stable Checkpoint Release  
**Next Major Release:** v5.0.0 (LangGraph Modular Architecture Refactoring)

## Overview

This release represents a **stable checkpoint** of the Quibit RAG system before beginning the major v5.0.0 architectural refactoring. Version 4.9.0 is specifically tagged for **easy rollback** during the upcoming modular LangGraph implementation.

## Key Features in This Release

### üîß **Core System Improvements**
- **Enhanced SimpleLangGraphWrapper**: Current monolithic implementation (3,622 lines) with improved error handling
- **Robust Chat Interface**: Enhanced UI components with better user experience
- **Improved Tool Integration**: Updated Tavily search tool with better error handling and response formatting
- **Enhanced Query Classification**: Refined query classification service with better intent detection

### üéØ **Development & Maintainability**
- **Type Safety Improvements**: Enhanced TypeScript definitions across core modules
- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundary implementation
- **Optimized Chat History**: Improved hooks and sidebar functionality for chat management
- **Enhanced Observability**: Better logging and debugging capabilities

### üìä **Technical Details**
- **Current Architecture**: Monolithic LangGraph wrapper (to be refactored in v5.0.0)
- **Total Lines Changed**: 2,133 insertions, 330 deletions across 8 files
- **Key Components**: SimpleLangGraphWrapper, Chat Interface, Tool Integrations, Type System

## What's Coming in v5.0.0

The next major release will implement a **complete architectural refactoring** based on the comprehensive plan:

### üèóÔ∏è **Planned v5.0.0 Changes**
- **Modular Architecture**: Break down 3,622-line monolith into focused, testable modules
- **LangGraph Best Practices**: Implement proper ReAct (Reason-Act-Observe) patterns
- **Service-Oriented Design**: Extract business logic into dedicated, reusable services
- **Enhanced Observability**: Built-in monitoring and debugging capabilities
- **Improved Maintainability**: Follow 200 LOC per file rule and clean separation of concerns

## Rollback Instructions

If issues arise during the v5.0.0 refactoring, you can easily rollback to this stable state:

```bash
# Rollback to v4.9.0 stable checkpoint
git checkout v4.9.0

# Or create a new branch from this checkpoint
git checkout -b rollback-to-v4.9.0 v4.9.0

# If you need to revert main branch
git reset --hard v4.9.0
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## System Requirements

- **Node.js**: v18+ 
- **TypeScript**: v5+
- **LangChain**: Current stable version
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Supabase
- **Deployment**: Vercel compatible

## Breaking Changes

None in this release - this is a stability checkpoint.

## Bug Fixes

- Enhanced error handling in SimpleLangGraphWrapper
- Improved chat history persistence
- Better tool execution error recovery
- UI component stability improvements

## Security Updates

- Updated dependency versions
- Enhanced input validation
- Improved error message sanitization

## Performance Improvements

- Optimized chat interface rendering
- Better memory management in long conversations
- Improved tool execution efficiency

## Migration Notes

No migration required for this release. This version serves as the baseline for the upcoming v5.0.0 architectural migration.
