# Uploaded Content Access Fix Implementation

## Problem Summary

When users uploaded documents to the Echo Tango chat bit and asked to "revise based on the attached document," the AI system was ignoring the uploaded content and instead pulling documents from the knowledge base. This created a poor user experience where uploaded content wasn't immediately accessible for analysis and revision.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was identified in the RAG pipeline workflow:

1. **File Upload & Extraction**: Working correctly - files were uploaded to Vercel Blob and content extracted via n8n
2. **Content Storage**: The extracted content was properly stored in attachment metadata
3. **Context Integration**: The brain API was processing attachments but the formatting wasn't clear enough
4. **AI Understanding**: When users referenced "attached document," the AI wasn't connecting this to the uploaded content sections

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Attachment Processing (`app/api/brain/route.ts`)

**Improved `processAttachments` function:**
- Changed formatting from generic "File attachment" to clear "### UPLOADED DOCUMENT" sections
- Added document type information
- Structured content with clear start/end markers

```typescript
// Before
attachmentContext += `\n\nFile attachment ${index + 1}: ${fileName} (${fileType})\nContent: ${extractedContent}\n`;

// After  
attachmentContext += `

### UPLOADED DOCUMENT ${index + 1}: "${fileName}" ###
Document Type: ${fileType}
Content:
${extractedContent}
### END DOCUMENT ${index + 1} ###
`;
```

**Context-Aware Integration:**
- Added detection for when users reference uploaded content
- Provided explicit instructions linking user references to uploaded content sections
- Improved attachment instruction messaging

```typescript
const hasReferences = /\b(attached|upload|document|file)\b/i.test(userMessageContent);

if (hasReferences) {
  attachmentInstruction = `\n\nNOTE: You are referencing uploaded document(s). The content of ${attachmentCount === 1 ? 'the uploaded document is' : `all ${attachmentCount} uploaded documents are`} provided below in the ### UPLOADED DOCUMENT sections. When you mention "attached document", "uploaded file", or similar terms, refer to the content in these sections.\n`;
}
```

### 2. New Tool for Uploaded Content Access (`lib/ai/tools/index.ts`)

**Added `getRecentlyUploadedContentTool`:**
- Serves as a fallback when AI tries to use knowledge base tools inappropriately
- Redirects attention back to uploaded content in the current context
- Provides clear guidance about where to find uploaded content

```typescript
const getRecentlyUploadedContentTool = new DynamicStructuredTool({
  name: 'getRecentlyUploadedContent',
  description: 'Access content from recently uploaded documents in the current chat session. Use this when users reference "attached document", "uploaded file", or similar terms.',
  schema: z.object({
    query: z.string().describe('What you are looking for in the uploaded content'),
  }),
  func: async ({ query }) => {
    return `REMINDER: The user has uploaded document(s) in this conversation. The content is already available in the ### UPLOADED DOCUMENT sections of your context. Please refer to that content directly instead of searching external knowledge bases. Look for sections marked with "### UPLOADED DOCUMENT" in your current context to find the uploaded content related to: ${query}`;
  },
});
```

### 3. Enhanced System Prompt Instructions (`lib/ai/prompts/core/base.ts`)

**Added specific guidance for uploaded content:**
- Clear instructions about recognizing user references to uploaded documents
- Priority guidance to check uploaded content before using knowledge base tools
- Explicit instructions for revision requests

```typescript
## Working with Uploaded Content
- When users reference "attached document", "uploaded file", "the document I uploaded", or similar terms, they are referring to content in the ### UPLOADED DOCUMENT sections of the conversation context.
- Always check for ### UPLOADED DOCUMENT sections in your context before using knowledge base tools.
- If uploaded content is available, use it directly rather than searching external knowledge bases.
- When users ask to "revise based on the attached document" or similar requests, prioritize the uploaded content over existing knowledge base documents.
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Upload Flow (Unchanged)
1. User uploads file via multimodal input component
2. File is uploaded to Vercel Blob storage
3. n8n workflow extracts content
4. Extracted content is attached as metadata to the file attachment

### Enhanced Chat Processing Flow
1. **Message Processing**: Brain API receives message with attachments
2. **Attachment Processing**: `processAttachments` function formats content with clear markers
3. **Context Integration**: Attachment content is integrated with context-aware instructions
4. **AI Processing**: System prompt guides AI to prioritize uploaded content
5. **Fallback Tool**: If AI still tries knowledge base, new tool redirects to uploaded content

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Availability**: Uploaded content is immediately accessible in the same chat session
2. **Clear Context**: Improved formatting makes uploaded content more prominent
3. **User Intent Recognition**: System better understands when users reference uploaded documents
4. **Fallback Protection**: New tool prevents inappropriate knowledge base usage
5. **Better UX**: Users can upload and immediately work with documents as expected

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Upload Test**: Upload a document and ask to "revise based on the attached document"
2. **Reference Test**: Use various phrases like "the uploaded file", "attached document", etc.
3. **Multiple Files**: Test with multiple uploaded documents
4. **Fallback Test**: Verify the new tool works if AI tries knowledge base tools

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persistent Storage**: Consider storing uploaded content in the knowledge base for long-term access
2. **Cross-Session Access**: Enable access to uploaded content across chat sessions
3. **Content Indexing**: Add semantic search capabilities for uploaded content
4. **File Type Expansion**: Enhance support for additional file types

## Files Modified

- `app/api/brain/route.ts`: Enhanced attachment processing and context integration
- `lib/ai/tools/index.ts`: Added new tool for uploaded content access
- `lib/ai/prompts/core/base.ts`: Added system prompt instructions for uploaded content

This implementation ensures that uploaded documents are immediately accessible and properly prioritized when users reference them, fixing the core issue in the RAG pipeline workflow.
