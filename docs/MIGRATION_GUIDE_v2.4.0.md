- Automatic parent task detection for subtask operations
- Conversation context integration for improved UX

#### Comprehensive Search & Discovery
- Type-aware search with resource filtering

## Breaking Changes

**None** - This is a backwards-compatible release that only adds new functionality.

## Migration Steps

### 1. Update Dependencies

```bash
# Update to the latest version
git pull origin main
pnpm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables

No new environment variables are required. All existing Asana configuration remains the same:

```env
ASANA_PAT=your_asana_personal_access_token
ASANA_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_GID=your_workspace_gid
ASANA_DEFAULT_TEAM_GID=your_team_gid # (optional)
ASANA_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS=30000 # (optional)
```

### 3. Database Migration

No database changes are required for this release.

### 4. Testing New Features

After upgrading, test the new functionality:

#### Task Dependencies
```bash
# Test dependency creation
"Make task 'Code Review' dependent on task 'Development'"

# Test dependency removal  
"Remove dependency between 'Testing' and 'Deployment'"
```

#### Enhanced User Operations
```bash
# Test user details
"Get user details for john@company.com"

# Test workspace users listing
"Show me all users in the workspace"
```

#### Subtask Context Memory
```bash
# Create a task first
"Create task 'Project Alpha' in Development project"

# Then add subtask (should automatically detect parent)
"Add subtask 'Phase 1 Planning'"
```

## New API Capabilities

### Task Dependencies
- `ADD_TASK_DEPENDENCY`: Create task dependencies
- `REMOVE_TASK_DEPENDENCY`: Remove task dependencies
- Enhanced entity extraction for dependency operations
- Natural language processing for complex dependency scenarios

### User Management

- `LIST_WORKSPACE_USERS`: List all users in workspace
- Enhanced user lookup with email and name disambiguation
- Improved assignee resolution for tasks

### Context Management
- Task context memory system for subtask operations
- Cross-session context preservation
- Conversation context integration
- Session-based context tracking

## Performance Improvements

### Caching Enhancements
- Improved cache hit rates for frequently accessed data
- Enhanced TTL-based caching strategies
- Optimized API call patterns

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for all new operations
- User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
- Enhanced retry logic with exponential backoff

### Type Safety
- Complete TypeScript compliance across all modules
- Enhanced type safety for all API operations
- Improved IDE support and development experience

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Task Dependencies Not Working
```bash
# Ensure task names are exact or use GIDs
"Make task '1234567890123456' dependent on task '1234567890123457'"

# Check task exists in current workspace
"Search for tasks named 'Development'"
```

#### User Lookup Issues
```bash
# Use full email address for user lookup
"Get user details for john.doe@company.com"

# Check workspace access
"List all users in workspace"
```

#### Context Memory Issues
```bash
# Create explicit parent task reference
"Add subtask 'Planning' to task 'Project Alpha'"
```

### Debugging

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues:

```env
# Add to your .env.local
DEBUG=asana:*
```

Check the console for detailed operation logs:
```
[AsanaTool] [req_123] Classified intent: ADD_TASK_DEPENDENCY
[AsanaTool] [req_123] Resolved dependent task: 1234567890123456
[AsanaTool] [req_123] Resolved dependency task: 1234567890123457
```
