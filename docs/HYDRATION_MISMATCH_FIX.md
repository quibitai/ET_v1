# Hydration Mismatch Fix for Browser Extensions

## Problem Description

React hydration mismatch errors were occurring in the `SidebarUserNav` component due to browser extensions (specifically HoverZoom) modifying DOM elements after server-side rendering but before client-side hydration.

### Error Details

- **Component**: `SidebarUserNav` 
- **Element**: `<Image>` components in user avatar
- **Root Cause**: HoverZoom browser extension automatically adds `hoverZoomLink` class to image elements
- **Timing**: Extension modifies DOM between SSR and React hydration

### Error Manifestation

```
Error: A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties.
Server: className="rounded-full cursor-pointer"
Client: className="rounded-full cursor-pointer hoverZoomLink"
```

## Solution Implemented

Added `suppressHydrationWarning={true}` to all `<Image>` components in `SidebarUserNav` that are susceptible to browser extension modifications.

### Code Changes

```tsx
<Image
  src={`https://avatar.vercel.sh/${user?.email || 'placeholder'}`}
  alt={user?.email ?? 'user'}
  width={30}
  height={30}
  className="rounded-full cursor-pointer"
  suppressHydrationWarning={true}  // ← Added this
/>
```

### Files Modified

- `components/sidebar-user-nav.tsx` - Added `suppressHydrationWarning={true}` to 3 Image components

## Technical Rationale

1. **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Application code remains focused on business logic while gracefully handling external modifications
2. **User Experience Preserved**: Users can continue using HoverZoom and other browser extensions without breaking the application
3. **Minimal Performance Impact**: Suppression only affects hydration warnings, not runtime performance
4. **Architectural Best Practice**: Follows React's documented pattern for third-party DOM modifications

## Browser Extensions Compatibility

This fix makes the application compatible with:
- HoverZoom (confirmed)
- Similar image enhancement extensions
- Any extension that modifies image element classes

## Testing

- ✅ Hydration errors eliminated
- ✅ HoverZoom extension functionality preserved
- ✅ No impact on application functionality
- ✅ Clean development console output
