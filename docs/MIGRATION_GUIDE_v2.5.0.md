- **Better Memory Usage**: Improved component lifecycle management
- **Enhanced Responsiveness**: Better coordination between UI updates and data changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **Artifacts Not Displaying Properly**
```bash
# Clear browser cache and restart
# Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

#### **Links Not Clickable**
- This should be automatically resolved in v2.5.0
- If issues persist, check browser console for errors

#### **Close Button Not Working**
- This critical issue has been fixed in v2.5.0
- Clear browser cache if you still experience issues

#### **Streaming Issues**
```bash
# Check server logs for any errors
pnpm dev

# Verify API routes are responding
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"test"}]}'
```

### Getting Help

If you encounter any issues during migration:

1. **Check the Console**: Look for any JavaScript errors in the browser console
2. **Review Server Logs**: Check your application logs for any server-side errors
3. **Clear Cache**: Clear browser cache and restart the application
4. **Documentation**: Review the updated documentation in `/docs/`
5. **GitHub Issues**: Report any bugs or issues on the project repository

## Developer Notes

### Code Changes

#### **Component Updates**
- `ArtifactCloseButton`: Updated memoization strategy to allow prop updates
- `CollapsedArtifact`: New component for inline artifact display
- `Artifact`: Enhanced with Markdown rendering for better link support

#### **API Changes**
