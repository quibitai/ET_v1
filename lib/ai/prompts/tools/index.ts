  // Knowledge Base Tools
  searchAndRetrieveKnowledgeBase: `PROACTIVE RESEARCH TOOL: Use this to find and retrieve the FULL content of internal documents, case studies, and examples. When a user asks for "the contents of a file" or to "find a document," use this tool immediately.

BUDGET CREATION WORKFLOW: When users ask to create budgets or estimates:
1. First check uploaded content for project details, scope, and requirements
2. Use this tool to search the knowledge base for "rate card", "pricing", "budget", and similar terms to get rate information.
3. Use found rate information to calculate costs based on uploaded project scope
4. Create detailed budget breakdowns with line items and totals
5. Do NOT ask users to upload rate cards if they exist in knowledge base`,

  listDocuments: `KNOWLEDGE BASE DISCOVERY TOOL: Use this tool to discover what documents are available in the knowledge base. Always use this tool first when the user asks about available documents or needs to explore knowledge base contents. The results provide document IDs needed for getDocumentContents.`,

  getDocumentContents: `DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL TOOL: Use this tool to fetch the full content of a specific document using its ID (preferred) or title. Always try to use document IDs from listDocuments results first for exact matches. For title-based retrieval, use the most specific title terms possible.`,

  getMultipleDocuments: `SMART MULTI-DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL TOOL: Use this tool for comparative analysis, synthesis, or when multiple documents are referenced in a single query. This tool automatically:
  
  1. DETECTS multi-document needs (comparative analysis, "vs", "relationship", etc.)
  2. EXTRACTS all document references from the query automatically
  3. RETRIEVES multiple documents in parallel for efficiency
  4. PROVIDES relationship mapping for comparative analysis
  
  **WHEN TO USE**: 
  - "Compare [Document A] and [Document B]"
  - "How do [Document A] and [Document B] align?"
  - "What's the relationship between [Document A] and [Document B]?"
  - Any query mentioning multiple documents or requiring comparative analysis
  
  **ADVANTAGES over individual getDocumentContents calls**:
  - Parallel retrieval (faster)
  - Automatic document detection
  - Built-in relationship mapping
  - Better error handling for missing documents
  
  **USAGE**: Simply pass the user's query and the tool will handle document extraction and retrieval automatically.`,

  // Web Search Tools
  tavilySearch: `PROACTIVE RESEARCH TOOL: Use immediately for company information, current events, industry research, or any external information needed. Always search when users mention specific companies, organizations, or need current data. Synthesize results into comprehensive responses.`,

  // Integration Tools
  googleCalendar: `Use this tool ONLY for Google Calendar related tasks and operations. This tool is now dedicated to calendar management. For any calendar-related requests, provide a clear natural language description of what you need.`,

  // Content Processing Instructions
  createBudget: `Use this tool to structure and calculate detailed budgets for video production projects. Pass project scope from uploaded content, rate card information from knowledge base searches, and additional project details. Always use this for budget creation requests.`,

  // Asana Function Calling Tools
  asana_get_project_details: `Use this tool to get detailed information about a specific Asana project including description, status, milestones, and tasks. Use when users ask for project details, project overview, or project information. Provide the project name or GID as project_id.`,
  asana_list_projects: `Use this tool to list and discover projects in the Asana workspace. Use when users want to see available projects or find a project by name. Can filter by team or include archived projects.`,
  asana_create_task: `Use this tool to create new tasks in Asana. Provide task name, optional description, project, assignee, and due date. The tool handles semantic resolution of project and user names.`,
  asana_list_tasks: `Use this tool to list tasks from Asana with optional filtering by project, assignee, or completion status. Use when users want to see their tasks or tasks in a specific project.`,
  asana_update_task: `Use this tool to update an existing task in Asana. Provide the task GID or name and the fields to update (e.g., description, assignee, due date, completion status).`,
  asana_create_comment: `Use this tool to add comments to Asana tasks or projects. Provide the GID of the task/project and the comment text.`,
  asana_search_tasks: `Use this tool to perform a semantic search for tasks across all projects in Asana. Use when you need to find tasks related to a specific topic, keyword, or user.`,
