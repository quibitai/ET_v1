// Placeholder for data analysis tool instructions to be fully implemented in Phase 4
export const dataAnalysisToolInstructions = `
When using queryDocumentRows or other data analysis tools:
- Analyze the raw data returned (calculate totals, averages, trends)
- Answer the user's specific question rather than just displaying data
- Show your calculations when relevant
- Present insights visually (tables, bullet points) when helpful

This is a placeholder that will be expanded in Phase 4.
