# LangGraph Modular Architecture

This directory contains the modular LangGraph implementation for the Quibit RAG system. This document outlines the target architecture for the ongoing refactor, which replaces the monolithic `SimpleLangGraphWrapper.ts` with a clean, maintainable, and observable system.

## 🏗️ **Target Architecture**

The final architecture is designed to separate concerns into distinct layers: execution, business logic, and infrastructure.

## 🏆 **Architectural Vision**

The goal of this refactor is to move from a monolithic system to a modular one, unlocking significant benefits in maintainability, testability, and observability.

### **Before (Current Legacy System)**
- **Single File**: Much of the core logic resides in `SimpleLangGraphWrapper.ts`.
- **Embedded Logic**: Business logic is tightly coupled with execution flow.
- **Limited Observability**: Basic logging with minimal metrics.
- **Hard to Test**: Monolithic methods are difficult to isolate.
- **Poor Maintainability**: Changes require understanding a large, complex file.

### **After (Target Modular System)**
- **Execution Layer**: Clean nodes (`agent.ts`, `tools.ts`, `generateResponse.ts`).
- **Business Logic Layer**: Dedicated, reusable services in `lib/ai/services/`.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Future wrappers and `ObservabilityService`.
- **Principle Adherence**: All new files will adhere to a strict 200 LOC architectural principle.
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive monitoring, caching, and error handling.

## 🔄 **Control Flow Principles (Target)**

The graph will follow a **ReAct (Reason-Act-Observe) pattern** with **corrected logic**:

```
START → Agent → Tools → Agent → Generate Response → END
                ↑_______|        |
                                 ↓
                               END
```

1. **Agent Node**: Will analyze queries and use services for intelligent routing and decision-making.
2. **Tools Node**: Will execute tools with robust error handling and timeout management.  
3. **Agent Node (Re-entry)**: Will process tool results, using services to decide the next step (e.g., respond to the user, call another tool).
4. **Generate Response Node**: Will create the final user-facing response.

**Key Principle**: Tools will ALWAYS return to the Agent for result processing to ensure proper reasoning and observation steps.

## 🔄 **Architecture Overview**

The graph follows a **ReAct (Reason-Act-Observe) pattern** with **corrected logic**:

```
START → Agent → Tools → Agent → Generate Response → END
                ↑_______|        |
                                 ↓
                               END
```

### **Control Flow Principles**

1. **Agent Node**: Analyzes queries, uses services for intelligent decisions
2. **Tools Node**: Executes tools with timeout management and error handling  
3. **Agent Node**: Processes tool results using business logic services
4. **Generate Response Node**: Creates final responses with mode-based formatting
5. **Router**: Manages flow with corrected ReAct logic

**Key Principle**: Tools ALWAYS return to Agent for result processing (ReAct pattern).

### **Service Integration**

- **Document Analysis**: Multi-document scenario detection and response strategy  
- **Query Analysis**: Intent classification and complexity assessment
- **Performance Tracking**: Real-time monitoring with health status

// Load graph-specific prompts
await loadGraphPrompt({
  nodeType: 'agent' | 'synthesis' | 'simple' | 'conversational',
  state: GraphState,
  currentDateTime: string,
  availableTools: string[],
});

// Determine appropriate response mode
const mode = determineResponseMode(userQuery);
// Returns: 'synthesis' | 'simple' | 'conversational'
```

### **Integration with Existing System**

- Specialist prompts (stored in database) handle persona/role definitions
- Graph prompts handle node execution logic and response generation
- Both systems can work together for enhanced functionality

```typescript
// OLD (Monolithic)
const wrapper = new SimpleLangGraphWrapper(config);

// NEW (Modular)
const wrapper = createModularLangGraphWrapper({
  llm: config.llm,
  tools: config.tools,
  logger: config.logger,
  enableCaching: true,        // NEW: Intelligent caching
  enableMetrics: true,        // NEW: Performance monitoring
  cacheTimeout: 300000,       // NEW: 5-minute cache TTL
  maxConcurrentTools: 5,      // NEW: Concurrent tool execution
});

// Enhanced capabilities
const metrics = wrapper.getExecutionMetrics();    // Performance analytics
const cacheStats = wrapper.getCacheStatistics();  // Cache efficiency
