# Development Roadmap v7.0.0 - REVISED - Production-Ready RAG Application

> **Single Source of Truth** - Supersedes all previous roadmaps and planning documents  
> **Created**: January 2025 (Revised based on recent achievements)  
> **Focus**: Tool Architecture Cleanup, Documentation Consolidation, LangSmith Integration, and Production Deployment

## üéØ Executive Summary

**Current State Assessment**: Based on comprehensive architectural audit and recent development achievements, the application has sophisticated tool architecture with **significant progress** on Google Workspace integration:

### **‚úÖ Recent Major Achievements**

- **Google Workspace OAuth Implementation**: Complete OAuth bridge service with token management
- **MCP Client Integration**: Comprehensive Google Workspace MCP client with 54 tools
- **Authentication Flow**: Working OAuth 2.0 flow with session management and token refresh
- **Tool Execution**: Functional Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Forms, and Chat tools

### **üö® Remaining Critical Issues**

- **Tool Selection Confusion**: Knowledge base tools conflicting with Google Drive tools
- **Admin Dashboard Issues**: Interface components not functioning properly
- **Legacy Code Accumulation**: Fragmented documentation and deprecated implementations
- **Missing LangSmith Integration**: No systematic tracing, prompt engineering, or agent management
- **Asana MCP Status**: Needs verification and testing

## üö® Critical Issues Identified (REVISED)

### **Issue #1: Tool Selection Confusion (CRITICAL)**

**Problem**: LangGraph agent calls `get_drive_file_content` instead of `getDocumentContents` for knowledge base queries
**Root Cause**: Similar tool descriptions causing LLM confusion
**Impact**: Users cannot access knowledge base content
**Status**: üî¥ BLOCKING PRODUCTION

### **Issue #2: Google Workspace MCP Optimization (LOW-MEDIUM)**

**Problem**: Google Workspace MCP OAuth flow implemented but needs testing and optimization
**Root Cause**: Recent implementation needs validation and edge case handling
**Impact**: Google Workspace tools functional but may need refinement
**Status**: üü° NEEDS TESTING & OPTIMIZATION
**Achievement**: ‚úÖ **MAJOR PROGRESS** - OAuth bridge and authentication flow implemented

### **Issue #3: Admin Dashboard Not Working (HIGH)**

**Problem**: Admin interface components not functioning properly
**Root Cause**: Unknown - requires investigation
**Impact**: Cannot manage system configuration
**Status**: üü° NEEDS INVESTIGATION

### **Issue #4: Asana MCP Status Unknown (MEDIUM)**

**Problem**: Asana MCP tools status unclear - may be working or need fixes
**Root Cause**: Need to verify current implementation status
**Impact**: External project management integration uncertain
**Status**: üü° NEEDS VERIFICATION

### **Issue #5: Legacy Code Accumulation (MEDIUM)**

**Problem**: Multiple deprecated tool implementations and fragmented documentation
**Root Cause**: Previous development iterations leaving behind unused code
**Impact**: Code complexity and maintenance overhead
**Status**: üü° CLEANUP REQUIRED

### **Issue #6: Missing LangSmith Integration (HIGH)**

**Problem**: No systematic observability, prompt engineering, or agent management
**Root Cause**: LangSmith not properly integrated into development workflow
**Impact**: Limited debugging capabilities and optimization potential
**Status**: üü° ENHANCEMENT NEEDED

## üßπ Comprehensive Cleanup List - Files/Code to Remove

> **Priority-Based Cleanup Plan** - Organized by impact on production readiness and development efficiency

### **üö® CRITICAL PRIORITY - Blocking Production Deployment**

**Test API Routes** (Remove immediately - exposing internal endpoints):

- `app/api/test-oauth-flow/` (entire directory)
- `app/api/test-gmail-mcp/` (entire directory)
- `app/api/test-mcp-client/` (entire directory)
- `app/api/test-google-tools/` (entire directory)
- `app/api/test-unified-tools/` (entire directory)
- `app/api/test-minimal/` (entire directory)
- `app/api/test-tool-loading/` (entire directory)

**Middleware Cleanup Required**:

- Update `middleware.ts` line 39 to remove test route exceptions after deletion

### **üî• HIGH PRIORITY - Architecture & Documentation Cleanup**

**Outdated Planning Documents**:

- `Development_Roadmap_v6.0.0.md` (superseded by v7.0.0)
- `Development_Roadmap_v7.0.0.md` (superseded by REVISED version)

**Deprecated Components**:

- `components/editor-page-wrapper.tsx` (marked deprecated, no imports found)
- **Note**: `components/sidebar-toggle.tsx` is deprecated but still used in `chat-header.tsx:266` - needs replacement before removal

**Database Backup Archives** (Keep latest, remove dated):

- `database/backups/migration-backup-2025-06-27/` (entire directory - 22 files)
- `database/backups/SUPABASE_SCHEMA_BACKUP_2025-06-27T19-31-37-419Z.sql` (duplicate of LATEST)

### **üìã MEDIUM PRIORITY - Development Artifacts**

**Archived Database Scripts**:

- `database/scripts/archived/` (entire directory):
  - `migrate-specialists.ts` (3.6KB)
  - `phase1-setup.sh` (15KB)
  - `update-echo-tango-tools.sql` (5.7KB)
  - `update-echo-tango-with-google-workspace-tools.ts` (6.5KB)

**Deprecated Migration Files**:

- `database/migrations/deprecated/` (entire directory):
  - `drop_deprecated_tables.sql` (1.8KB)
  - `MULTI_TENANT_MIGRATION.md` (2.2KB)

### **üßΩ LOW PRIORITY - Test Artifacts & Housekeeping**

**Test Result Artifacts**:

- `test-results/.last-run.json` (45B)
- `playwright-report/index.html` (448KB - large file)

**Empty Directories**:

- `credentials/` (empty directory)
- `public/uploads/` (empty directory)

### **üìä Cleanup Impact Summary**

**Total Files to Remove**: ~35+ files
**Total Directories to Remove**: ~12 directories  
**Estimated Space Savings**: ~500KB+ (excluding large playwright report)
**Security Improvement**: Remove 7 test API endpoints from production
**Maintenance Reduction**: Eliminate deprecated code paths and outdated documentation

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-Removal Validation Required**

**Before removing any files, verify**:

1. **SidebarToggle Component**: Update `components/chat-header.tsx:266` to remove `<SidebarToggle />` usage
2. **Middleware Routes**: Update test route exceptions in `middleware.ts`
3. **Import Dependencies**: Run `npm run build` to catch any missing imports
4. **Database Dependencies**: Verify no active migrations reference archived scripts
