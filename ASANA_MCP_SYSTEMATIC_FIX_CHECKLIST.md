# Asana MCP Integration Systematic Fix - Implementation Checklist

## Overview
This checklist implements the systematic plan to fix all identified issues with the Asana MCP integration:
1. No hyperlinks in task responses (tasks showing as plain text instead of clickable links)
2. Unwanted limit of only 5 tasks when user has more incomplete tasks
3. System returning tasks assigned to other people instead of current user
4. Executive summary format despite wanting simple list responses
5. Redundant "References" sections appearing when links were already in response body

## Phase 1: Response Mode Detection Fixes (Priority 1) ✅ COMPLETE

### 1.1 Consolidate Response Mode Logic ✅
- [x] **Audit current response mode detection functions**
  - [x] Review `determineResponseMode()` in `lib/ai/graphs/router.ts`
  - [x] Review `determineResponseMode()` in `lib/ai/graphs/nodes/generateResponse.ts`
  - [x] Document conflicts between the two functions

- [x] **Create unified response mode utility**
  - [x] Create `lib/ai/utils/responseMode.ts`
  - [x] Implement single `determineResponseMode()` function
  - [x] Priority: User query intent over tool result count
  - [x] Keywords for simple mode: 'list', 'show', 'display', 'my tasks', 'what are'

- [x] **Update router.ts**
  - [x] Replace local `determineResponseMode()` with utility import
  - [x] Test response mode detection with various queries

- [x] **Update generateResponse.ts**
  - [x] Replace local `determineResponseMode()` with utility import
  - [x] Test response mode detection with various queries

### 1.2 Enhanced Keyword Detection ✅

  - [x] Analysis keywords: ['analyze', 'summary', 'overview', 'report', 'insights']
  - [x] Prioritize user intent over tool result metadata

**Phase 1 Results:**

  - [x] Implement proper pagination support
  - [x] Default to reasonable limits (20 tasks, max 100)

**Phase 3 Results - VERIFIED BY TESTING:**
- ✅ **MAJOR FIX**: Removed hard-coded 5-task limit (now 20 default, 100 max)
- ✅ **MAJOR FIX**: Fixed user identification using "me" parameter with authenticated token
- ✅ **MAJOR FIX**: Added workspace auto-detection (found: echotango.co workspace)
- ✅ **MAJOR FIX**: Enhanced error handling with troubleshooting guidance
